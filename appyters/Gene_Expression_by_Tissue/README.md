# Gene Expression across Human Cells and Tissues

The Appyter takes a human gene symbol as the input to produce box plots that display its expression across human cell types and tissue at the mRNA and protein levels.

This appyter utilizes normal tissue gene and protien expression from [GTEx](https://gtexportal.org/home/) [1], [ARCHS4](https://maayanlab.cloud/archs4/) [2], and the [Tabula Sapiens](https://tabula-sapiens-portal.ds.czbiohub.org/) [3], the [Human Protein Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/about/download) [4], the [Human Proteome Map](https://www.humanproteomemap.org/download.php) [5], and the [GTEx proteome project](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.036) [6].

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project was supported by the Common Fund of the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and by NCI, NHGRI, NHLBI, NIDA, NIMH, and NINDS [1]. GTEx Version 8 gene counts were processed to produced gene summary statistics. ARCHS4 provides access to gene counts from HiSeq 2000, HiSeq 2500 and NextSeq 500 platforms for human and mouse experiments from GEO and SRA [2]. ARCHS4 Version 11 was processed to produce gene summary statistics. Tabula Sapiens is funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and is the product of Tabula Sapiens Consortium [3]. Tabula Sapiens data was processed from all 15 donors to produce gene summary statistics.

Proteomics data were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas [4] with IHC-based expression profiling, the Human Proteome Map [5] with MS-based expression quantification, and a GTEx proteome project [6] using TMT MS.
