# Gene Set Library Synopsis

Gene Set Library Synopsis Appyter performs gene set analysis on a GMT file. The required input is a GMT file. The Appyter performs basic statistics, calculates and visualizes significant pairwise intersections between gene sets, available for download. The appyter calculates pairwise similarity metrics, including Jaccard and Otuska-Ochiai. Finally, the appyter performs hierarchical clustering and provides visualizations of the clusters using a dendrogram and heatmap. 

## **File Format**
To run the Appyter, a .gmt file is required as input.  To create your own GMT file, please see Enrichr. Enrichr, hosted by the Ma'ayan Laboratory at Mt. Sinai Icahn School of Medicine, is a collection of geneset libraries.
