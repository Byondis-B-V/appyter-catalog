# Gene Set Library Analysis

The Gene Set Library Analysis Appyter performs gene set analysis on a GMT file. The required input is a GMT file. The Appyter performs basic statistics and infers significant pairwise intersections between gene sets. The appyter also calculates pairwise similarity metrics (options include Jaccard, Otsuka-Ochiai). Finally, the appyter performs hierarchical clustering on the given gene sets. Visualizations are provided throughout.  

## **File Format**
To run the appyter, a .gmt file is required as an input.  To create your own GMT file, please see Enrichr. Enrichr, hosted by the Ma'ayan Laboratory at Mt. Sinai Icahn School of Medicine, is a collection of geneset libraries.
