# Using Appyters

The Appyter Catalog facilitates the integration of many individual Appyters into a unified web interface that presents each Appyter and provides various means of categorization and search. Type any key terms in the search bar, or click on the blue filter buttons, to locate the Appyters that fit your data analysis needs. Then, invoke the Appyter by clicking on its card. The first screen will provide an overview description of the Appyter and a button to invoke the data entry form. Click on this button to gain access to the data entry form. Then, fill out the form by making selections and uploading data to satisfy all the form elements. Once this is ready, press the Submit button to invoke the execution of the Jupyter Notebook report. You will be presented with the report with an indication that it is executing. One execution is complete, the report is ready to view and share.
