# appyter-catalog: A catalog of appyters

<https://appyters.maayanlab.cloud/>

This repository contains source code for the catalog and the appyters in it and is used to assemble and run them all, not to be confused with the [appyter python package](https://github.com/maayanLab/appyter/) for actually developing appyters of your own.
